              I used to think coding was boring, until I realized it wasn’t the subject—it 
              was how it was being taught. Adult tutorials took hours, 
              but when a peer explained it, everything made sense in minutes. 
              Kids explain things differently than adults: we share the same slang, 
              the same frustrations, and we remember exactly which parts are confusing 
              because we just went through them ourselves. 
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">
              That’s the power of peer learning—it makes coding fun, relatable, and 
              less intimidating. That insight shaped the beginning of my first camp, 
              and it’s what continues to drive them today.
